## How it Works ?
1. Build the required UI for your project in Figma and add the plugin.
2. For the plugin, you must provide the access token generated from your GitHub settings. Make sure sufficient permissions are given for proper functioning.
3. Before exporting the actual design, you could click the plugin to create the repo and deploy the basic page.
4. After making sure that the page is deployed, you could choose the frame you want to export and press the deploy button in the plugin.
5. The raw scripts would be sent to the server which would later modify the repo files to deploy the page you have designed and voil√† you page is ready !!!
